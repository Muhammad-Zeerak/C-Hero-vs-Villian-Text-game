# C-Hero-vs-Villian-Text-game

assign.c - This file contains the main() function and contains code to implement the interactive mode, which uses the functions contained in characterRecord.h. It allows the user to interactively query and manipulate the hero and villain character information. The array of structures for the character (hero and villain) information must be defined within the main() function in file assign.c.

characterRecord.h - This file contains the function prototypes for functions to load, query, and manipulate the character (hero and villain) information (stored in the array of structures). This file must not be altered with the exception of completing the data structure declaration.

characterRecord.c - This file contains the implementations of the function prototypes listed in characterRecord.h. It may also contain additional functions (to assist in your implementation of the functions listed in characterRecord.h)
